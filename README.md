**⭐️--------------------------BUILD AND RUN EXPRESS-------------------------⭐️**
1. Create a directory and cd into it, ` touch server.js + npm init + code . `
2. Create a basic Express server, installing a express package `npm i express`. Packages added! ✅
3. Built a Basic Structure of Express App (const express = require..., listen port... and etc.)
4. Run the Server : `nodemon`.

**⭐️--------------------------BUILD A LANDING PAGE-------------------------⭐️**
1. Create a landing page using EJS templates. We need to install it: `npm i ejs
`.
2. Build the route. (app.get('/', ... etc)). 🟢server.js
3. Create a views directory and create a ejs file into it: `mkdir views + touch views/index.ejs`. Our landpage will be the `index.ejs` file.
4. Add the boilerplate and content inside. 🟣views
5. Modify the response in the server's route handler usind the `res.render()` method, instead of `res.send()`. So when the user visits the root `/`, they will see our homepage, change it to: `res.render('index.ejs');`. 🟢server.js

**⭐️-------------------USE MONGOOSE TO CONNECT TO MONGODB ---------------⭐️**

1. We need to install Mongoose and dotenv from NPM: `npm i mongoose dotenv`. Installed! ✅
2. Create a .env file in your project’s root directory: `touch .env`. 
This file will be used to store any sensitive, secret information that the application needs to run, but that we don’t want to commit to GitHub.
3. Create `touch .gitignore` file, and add it to it: `.env`, `node_modules/` and `package-lock.json` .  🔴.gitignore
4. Edit our `.env` file, add a simple list of key-value pairs:  ⚪️.env
```Javascript 
SECRET_NUMBER=13
PASSWORD=12345
```
5. Add a connection string, paste your MongoDB Atlas connection string into your app's `.env` file assigning it to a MONGODB_URI environment variable. ⚪️.env
`MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@sei.azure.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true`
6. Name your database collection. You can specify the preferred collection name by adding it between the / and the ? in the connection string: `/fruits?`. You MUST update this this to your preferred collection's name. ⚪️.env
7. Connecting MongoDB in server.js. Require the `dotenv` package at the ***top*** of our server.js file to access them: 🟢server.js
```Javascript
const dotenv = require("dotenv");
dotenv.config();
``` 
8. Require Mongoose so that we can use it to connect to our database:
`const mongoose = require("mongoose");`
9. We will also add a connection message that will print out our terminal when we've connected to the database. `mongoose.connect()` method:
```Javascript
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGODB_URI);
mongoose.connection.on("connected", () => {
  console.log(`Connected to MongoDB ${mongoose.connection.name}.`);
});
```
10. Start the app: `nodemon`.

**⭐️-------------------BUILD THE FRUIT MODEL ---------------⭐️**

1. Create a Models Directory and a Fruit file: `mkdir models + touch models/fruit.js`
2. Create a Schema and Model for Our Fruits:
   1. Create the schema.
   2. Link the schema to a model.
   3. Export the model. `module.exports = Fruit;`
 You should name models and model files singularly. 🟠models/fruits.js
3. Import the model into server.js, `const Fruit = require("./models/fruit.js");`  🟢server.js





**⭐️--------------------------NOTES 📝-------------------------⭐️**
- The server.js file is typically the main entry point and configuration file for setting up an Express web server.

- Use EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates to create the HTML views for the landing page and other parts of the web application.

- We need to stabilish a connection to a database. This connection will enable our application to store and retrieve data as we develop more features. 
We will use MongoDB Atlas, a cloud database service, along with Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

-Creating a Model: As we progress with our application, the next essential step is to create a schema and model for our fruits. This process will define how our fruit data is structured and stored in the database. By establishing a clear schema, we ensure consistency and reliability in the data we handle. Additionally, the model created from this schema will serve as the main interface for our application to interact with the MongoDB database, allowing us to perform CRUD operations on fruit data.
